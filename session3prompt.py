# Write a Python program that defines a function f(x) that returns x**3 + 8. In the main function of the program,
# call f(x) with x = 9 and print the result.  Use an if statement that executes if the result is larger than 27 and
# prints “YAY!”.

# def main()
    # instructions to be done
    # in the main function
    # with an indent

# if __name__ == __"main"__:
    # main()

def main():
    x = 9
    y = x**3 + 8
    print(y)

    if y > 27:
        print("YAY!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
